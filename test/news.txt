The government, however, apparently overlooked a law that requires a CPA to
receiver at least two years of partical training at a public accounting firm.
After realizing that, the FSS then suggested that firms listened on the Korea
Stock Exchange accommodate the newly minted CPAs, but accountants rejected the
idea. "The main purpose of selecting more CPAs is to ensure transparent
accounting," said Yoon Jong-wook, head of the CPAs' own comittee for improving
training conditions.
